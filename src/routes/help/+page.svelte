<h1>How to use Listodon</h1>
<p>
  If you have multiple distinct interests‚Äîe.g. politics and tech‚Äîand you follow people in both
  arenas, Mastodon will intermingle their posts. If you don‚Äôt like the intermingling, you have a
  couple options:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make accounts on different servers, e.g. a politics server and a tech server. Follow different
    people from different accounts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make Lists for your topics of interest: a Politics list and a Tech list. Whenever you follow
    someone you add them to one of your lists. (Mastodon doesn‚Äôt notify them.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Listodon is for option 2. What if you follow people and forget to add them to a list? Listodon
  will tell you. The first time you run it, it asks for permission to look at your account. Then it
  looks at everyone you follow, and makes sure you‚Äôve remembered to put them all in lists. It shows
  you everyone you haven‚Äôt put in a list.

<p>How do you fix it? Follow the link to the person‚Äôs profile on Mastodon and click:</p>
